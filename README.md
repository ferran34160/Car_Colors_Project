# Mid-Bootcamp Project: Relationship between car accidents and color of the vehicle
### Overview
This project is carried out with the aim of finding the possible relationship between car accidents and its color.

The data used in this project comes from the Barcelona's City Hall Open Data Service (https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/dataset/accidents-vehicles-gu-bcn). 

### Motivation
Knowing that many car insurance companies base their rates not only on the age of the driver, engine or car model, but also on the color of the car, I have decided to carry out this project to find out if there is a direct relationship between these two factors.
